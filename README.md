# Project 4 Hunter Game
 Word guessing OOJS project


This is the Phrase Hunter game, but with a twist, this is Phrase Hunter: Gamehendge Edition. 

What is Gamehendge? That is a great question, and to spare you a lot of nerdiness I will just say it is a 'Concept Album' by the band Phish. If you want to learn more, check these links:

I am going for the 'exceeds' grade, and beyond the 'Gamehendge' theme I've gone for I have also added some jQuery styling, along with some minor CSS changes and additions.
    
    Styling Changes include:
    -jQuery to fade in the "Gamehendge Edition" text on the initial start screen.
    -jQuery to fade in the "Gamehendge Edition" text on load of the game screen.
    -jQuery to fade out and remove any lost hearts during gameplay.
    -CSS to give color to the subtitle id
