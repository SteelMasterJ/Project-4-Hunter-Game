# Project 4 Hunter Game
 Word guessing OOJS project


This is the Phrase Hunter game, but with a twist, this is Phrase Hunter: Gamehendge Edition. 

What is Gamehendge? That is a great question, and to spare you a lot of nerdiness I will just say it is a 'Concept Album' by the band Phish. If you want to learn more, check these links:

I am going for the 'exceeds' grade, and beyond the 'Gamehendge' theme I've gone for i have also added som jQuery styling to the inital load page as well as ive added some fade animations to the heart images, along with some minor CSS changes and additions.
